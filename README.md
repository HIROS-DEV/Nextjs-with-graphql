## Impressions

It is my first Next.js project with GraphQL.
(It is my first time to use Chakra UI, also)

These days, I am learning GraphQL and I noticed GraphQL is terrific.
I would like to know more about GraphQL, so I took the Course.

Against all expectations, this course does not teach about GraphQL.
But, anyway, I am generally satisfied with the content.
(Of course, I would like to learn more about GraphQL though)

Thank you for reading. And, happy coding!!!
